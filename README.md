# Java Server

This is a working example, demo of a server written in Java 1.5.

# Demo

There's an example of this library being used in the package `convivial.communism.server.example`.

# Why the awful package names?

Because I was a kid, a young programmer who didn't know any better and thought two long, hard to spell, words meant it was a good package name.
